For reference in case the master donkeycar has changed too much, I forked the version of donkeycar that we used into here:

#### First, some explaining to do:
Instead of writing a seperate mode for the sonic sensors by themselves and then the sonic+camera together, I didn't have the foresight that I would have to go back, so I did the lazy thing. In the folders 'Sonic' and 'Sonic+Camera' are the files for 'manage.py' and 'keras.py' for that version. 

To differentiate my comments from those that pre-existed, mine will begin with '##@@##'


# First: Modify tub.py to accept 'listfloat'

tub.py can be found in donkey/donkeycar/management/tub.py
