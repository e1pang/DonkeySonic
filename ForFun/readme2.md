This was done AFTER the final presentation. This is what the car should have been (without the 2 embarassing things mentioned in the main readme). For fun, here it is.

Warning: I don't have the car with me right now and I won't be coming back to finish, so the code is NOT DEBUGGED AT ALL. THERE WILL BE ERROS.

Under the three modes,

c- camera only

s- sonic only

cs- camera and sonic


Both the camera AND the sonic sensors are taking data and saving it during user drive mode.
The difference is that driving with a model and training that model are different.
